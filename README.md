# Deep CNN for Environmental Sound Classification 
 The code implements the Deep CNN model described in Salamon and Bello's paper for Environmental Sound Classification on Urbansound8k dataset

The code is Divided into 2 parts.
 1-Data processing
 2-Training Model

Download the Urbansound8k data from the following (or any other working) link 'https://wp.nyu.edu/sonyc/resources/' and preprocess the data so that it is converted into Log Mel Spectrograms using the code.
Once done, train the 5 layer CNN model by this data using the 2nd code.
